# Simple Ejection System

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] Introduces stress levels and ejection rolls for pilots.

## Gameplay changes
* When Mechs take damage their pilots will be forced to resist stress
    * Depending on damage amount, locations lost, general health of their mechs they sometimes will get stressed
    * Upon reaching a critical stress level they'll start considering ejection
    * This will affect *all* pilots except you, the commander
* At the start of each round pilots have the chance to get a grip and lower their stress level
* Pilots with a critical stress level will also consider ejection upon activation
* Vigilance(Defensive Push) will most likely decrease stress level for your pilot
    * Consider saving some resolve for critical situations
* The general condition of your pilots is displayed on portrait hover instead of the redundant display of health
    * Right-Click on portraits will show a more detailed breakdown
